Dagor Engine
This project has a heavy reliance on code found in Dagor Engine, Particularly their ECS system.
Much of the ECS derived code can be found in /replay.
there is some minor references to related code in /src aswell (DataBlock, BitStream (nearly fully copied), and VROMFs)
Code has either been:
1: Directly Copied: all of these files should still contain the reference to Dagor Engine at the top
2: Slight modification: the code is mostly unchanged, but modified to rework a feature slightly or to make the code work with my system
3: Rewrite: the code was almost entirely written by me, LivingTheDagor, but was inspired / derived by the corresponding code on Dagor Engine
4: Reverse Engineered from the aces.exe binary
